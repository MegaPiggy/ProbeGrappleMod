### What it does?

It gives the player a new equipment to use: a *grappling rope*, it acts like a long rubber band and can have its size increased and decreased

### How do I use it?

Here is what each button does:

  **G** - Places the rope anchor at any aiming surface (you can be at max. 2 m away from it) | Retrieves the anchor
  
  **T** - Makes the rope longer: at each quarter of a second that the button is held, it has an increase of  25 cm
  
  **Y** - Same as the **T** button, but it decreases the rope size (untill it reaches 75 cm)
